<li><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND IHF NJNY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED. </strong>This Section is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and IHF NJNY agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The parties shall exercise their best efforts to resolve by negotiation all disputes, controversies, or differences between them. In the absence of an explicit written agreement to the contrary, all disputes between the parties, or any principal, executive, affiliate or agent of the parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or any other basis for legal liability, shall be resolved as follows:
<ol>
<li>In the event that the parties are not able to resolve by negotiation their disputes, controversies or differences, the aggrieved party shall provide written notice to the other party (&ldquo;Receiving party&rdquo;) of its intent to initiate arbitration as provided for herein. Said notice, hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;<strong>Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration</strong>&rdquo; shall include a) a brief description of the aggrieved party&rsquo;s claim or dispute and, if applicable b) a specified claim for money damages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Absent an express, written direction to the contrary by the receiving party, said notice(s) to the Company shall be forwarded to <a href="mailto:info@values-essential.org">info@ihf-njny.org</a> and said notice(s) to the User shall be forwarded to the email address provided by the User to the Company.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The Receiving Party shall, within fifteen (15) days of their receipt of a Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration, respond to the aggrieved party. Said response shall include either a) an acceptance of the aggrieved party&rsquo;s demand OR a counterproposal for resolution of the dispute.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In the event that the Receiving Party does not agree to the Aggrieved Party&rsquo;s demand, or fails to respond to the Aggrieved Party&rsquo;s Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration within fifteen (15) days of their receipt of same, the aggrieved party may submit their claim for adjudication by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) as follows:
<ol>
<li>The parties hereby expressly agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claim(s) between the parties, or any principal, executive, affiliate or agent of the parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, or any other basis for legal liability, shall be deemed time-barred if not brought within one (1) year of the accrual of the applicable cause of action.</li>
<li>YOU, IHF NJNY AND AFFILIATES HEREBY WAIVE, WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE: (I) THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, EITHER AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER; AND (II) THE RIGHT TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS WITH CLAIMS OF ANY OTHER PERSON. The foregoing waiver is referred to herein as the &ldquo;class action waiver&rdquo;. YOU, IHF NJNY AND AFFILIATES further agree that no arbitrator shall have authority to conduct any arbitration in violation of the class action waiver or to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than the User and/or the Company and its Affiliates. The parties acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any claims and is non-severable from this Dispute Resolution section. If the class action waiver is voided, found unenforceable, or limited with respect to any claim for which the User seeks class-wide relief, then this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void with respect to such claim, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the class action waiver. However, the Dispute Resolution section shall remain valid with respect to all other claims and Disputes. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If and to the extent applicable, the claim shall be subject to the Consumer Rules and Procedures of the AAA (<u>org/consumer</u>).</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Pursuant to the AAA Consumer Rules (R-9), if a party&rsquo;s claim is within the jurisdiction of a small claims court, either party may choose to take the claim to that court instead of arbitration.</li>
<li>Absent a finding of potential prejudice by the arbitral tribunal, the matter shall be adjudicated by way of a desk decision and/or remote appearances. In the event that in-person hearings are required, the locale determination will be made after considering the positions of the parties, the circumstances of the parties and the dispute, and the Consumer Due Process Protocol.</li>
<li>The arbitral award shall be final and binding upon both parties.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All aspects of the arbitration shall be confidential, and the parties and the arbitrator shall not disclose to others, or permit disclosure of, any information related to the proceedings, including but not limited to discovery, testimony and other evidence, briefs and the award.</li>
<li>Absent a finding that a party's damages were occasioned by willful conduct or a result of gross negligence, the arbitrator shall not award attorney&rsquo;s fees, indirect, special, consequential, incidental or exemplary damages.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Arbitrator shall award attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs against a party found to have brought any claim (or counterclaim) that is found to be frivolous or wholly without merit.</li>
<li>Also notwithstanding the forgoing, the arbitrator shall award attorney&rsquo;s fees, filing fees, costs and actual damages a) incurred by a party required to answer or litigate a claim within an alternate court or tribunal where it is ultimately determined that such claim(s) come within this scope of this arbitration provision OR b) where the filing party failed to comply with their obligation to provide a timely Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration as outlined herein.</li>
