      <p><strong>SHARING PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
      <p>We may disclose your personal data to our employees or contractors who reasonably need access to user data to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>We share your personal data with third parties as detailed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share personal data for business purposes with service providers that provide us with services for operating the website, opening, and operating your account as well as providing ancillary services and solutions. These include, among others, hosting services, data and cybersecurity services, web analytics and performance tools, IT SaaS services, legal and financial advisors, or technical consultants. Consistent with applicable legal requirements, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to require third parties to adequately safeguard your personal data and only process it in accordance with our instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractors and sub-contractors:</strong> It may be necessary to share your information with our contractors and sub-contractors to help us deliver services offered on our website. Consistent with applicable legal requirements, we take appropriate technical and organizational measures to require contractors and sub-contractors to adequately safeguard your personal data and only process it in accordance with our instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>For legal reasons:</strong> We might need to share personal data with law enforcement agencies, public authorities or other parties in order to respond to a subpoena or court order, judicial process or regulatory authorities, if we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes; when we believe it is necessary or appropriate to disclose personal data to law enforcement authorities, such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Privacy Policy; to respond to claims against us; and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of INDIA HERITAGE FOUNDATION NJ/NY INC (IHF NJNY) , our customers, or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>In the context of a corporate transaction:</strong> Personal data will also be disclosed if we go through a business transition such as a merger, sale, transfer of all or a portion of the Company&rsquo;s assets, acquisition, or similar event.</li>
        <li>We may also disclose certain information about you and/or your use of our services to third parties without identifying your personally identifiable information for any lawful purpose, including, but not limited to, analyzing how our services are used, diagnosing technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions. We may de-identify personally identifiable information and share it in a de-identified or aggregated form with third parties, advertisers, and/or business partners for any lawful purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may allow third-party advertising servers to place advertisements within our services. These third-party advertising servers or advertising networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or device, the advertisements and links that appear within the services. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. We may provide such third parties with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that a certain number of people of a given demographic have clicked on their advertisement over a given time period). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach their target audience. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers&rsquo; wishes by displaying their advertisements to that target audience.</p>
      <p><strong>MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>
      <p>From time to time, with your prior consent, we may inform you of new offers, subscription options, our programs or other services that are offered through our website by email or other electronic means. You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by using the &lsquo;unsubscribe&rsquo; link in our emails or contacting us at [Insert Email Address].</p>
      <p>Where you have unsubscribed from our email updates or where you ask us to stop sending promotional or other offers, this will not affect any other interaction you have with INDIA HERITAGE FOUNDATION NJ/NY INC (IHF NJNY); for example, we will continue to send you emails related to your purchases or donations.</p>
      <p>We may ask you to confirm or update your marketing preferences if there are changes in the law, regulations, or the structure of our business.</p>
      <p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
      <p>We use cookies in connection with the operation of our website. Cookies are generally used for creating a more personalized experience for the website users.</p>
      <p>A cookie is a small file that is sent by a web server (where we host our website) to a web browser (from where you view a website) and which is then stored by the browser. The cookie contains an identifier which is stored in your browser and then sent back to our server each time your browser accesses our website. These cookies may either be &lsquo;persistent cookies&rsquo; (in which case they will continue to be held by your browser until they are deleted, or until a specified event/date) or they will be &lsquo;session cookies&rsquo; which expire when you close your browser.</p>
      <p>Usually, cookies do not hold any data by which you can be identified, although if we do hold personal data about you; for example, because you have subscribed to a service that we offer, the cookie may be linked to that data.</p>
      <p>We also use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For authentication purposes;</li>
        <li>To identify users who are using a subscription service;</li>
        <li>Personalizing the web browsing experience;</li>
        <li>Security;</li>
        <li>Advertising;</li>
        <li>User behavior analysis;</li>
        <li>Other as appropriate to fulfill above purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to cookies used by us, our service providers may also use cookies, and those cookies may also be stored in your browser when you visit our website.</p>
      <p>We use Google Analytics. This uses cookies to gather data about how users use our website. This data is used to create reports about that use. Further information about Google&rsquo;s use of data may be obtained from Google&rsquo;s website.</p>
      <p>If you wish to do so, then usually, you can prevent cookies from being downloaded to your browser and can delete those that have already been downloaded. How this may be achieved varies between different browsers. Consult the website of your browser provider for more details. However, you should be aware that if you block or delete cookies this may have a detrimental impact upon your ability to access our website, and the services that we provide. It may mean that not all of the facilities on our website will be accessible by you, or it may mean that you are unable to access any subscription services which we provide.</p>
      <p><strong>HOW DO WE USE COOKIES?</strong></p>
      <p>As with most online services, our website uses first-party and third-party cookies for several purposes. First-party cookies are mostly necessary for the website to function the right way, and they do not collect any of your personally identifiable data.</p>
      <p>The third-party cookies used on our website are mainly for understanding how the website performs, how you interact with our website, keeping our services secure, providing advertisements that are relevant to you, and all in all providing you with a better and improved user experience.</p>
      <p><strong>TYPES OF COOKIES WE USE</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Necessary Cookies:</strong> These cookies are essential for you to browse our website and use its features; without these necessary cookies, our website would not be able to operate. Necessary cookies identify registered users so that they can access member-only areas of the website and keep users logged in. If a user disables necessary cookies, that user will not be able to get to all of the content that a subscription entitles them to.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to remember the selections you make on our website so that your selections are saved for your next visits.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to analyze a user&rsquo;s journey through our website and to monitor performance of our website. These cookies only provide anonymized information that does not identify anybody personally. This information is then bundled with the similar information from the other users, so that we can analyze the general usage patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking pixels:</strong> These are used to implement tracking technology on our website. This tracking does not use your personal information; it uses anonymized data (i.e., data that cannot be tied specifically to you). We will not combine this data with your other personal information without your prior express permission.</li>
        <li><strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> These cookies are created by a website other than ours and are used to improve and monitor our website&rsquo;s performance, so you receive a better service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>HOW LONG WE STORE PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
      <p>We apply a general rule of keeping personal data only for as long as it is required and necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. However, in some circumstances, we will retain your personal data for longer periods of time.</p>
      <p>We will retain personal data as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations, e.g., so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenge; and in relation to personal information from closed accounts to comply with applicable laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Service and take other actions as permitted by law.</p>
      <p><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
      <p>The security of your information is important to us, and we will use all reasonable security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration of your information under our control.</p>
      <p>Only our administrators are allowed to access our website&rsquo;s password-protected server where your personal information is stored. We utilize SSL encryption.</p>
      <p>Our employees are bound by strict confidentiality agreements and a breach of this agreement would result in the employee&rsquo;s termination.</p>
      <p>While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The internet can be insecure at times and therefore, we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>
      <p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
      <p>You have the following rights in respect of your personal data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to be informed:</strong> To be informed about collection and use of your personal data;</li>
        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> To obtain information about how and on what basis your personal data is processed and to obtain a copy;</li>
        <li><strong>Right of rectification:</strong> To rectify inaccurate personal information;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to be forgotten (Right to erasure):</strong> To erase your personal data in limited circumstances where (a) you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal data; (b) we are processing your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests and you object to such processing, and we cannot demonstrate an overriding legitimate ground for the processing; (c) where you have provided your personal data to us with your consent and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process your personal data; and (d) where you believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> To restrict processing of your personal data where (a) the accuracy of the personal data is contested; (b) the processing is unlawful but you object to the erasure of the personal data; (c) we no longer require the personal information for the purposes for which it was collected, but it is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim; or (d) you have objected to us processing your personal data based on our legitimate interests and we are considering your objection;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Where you have provided your personal information to us with your consent, to ask us for a copy of this data in a structured, machine-readable format and to ask us to share (port) this data to another data controller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data by us and we may be required to no longer process your personal data.</p>
      <p>If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please contact our privacy officer and we will reply to you and send the information you requested free of charge in a suitable electronic form within 45 days.</p>
      <p>We will ask you for additional data to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing data requested by you.</p>
      <p>We will decline to process requests that jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or would cause us to take any action that is not permissible under applicable laws. Additionally, as permitted by applicable laws, we will retain where necessary certain personal data for a limited period of time for record-keeping, tax, accounting and fraud prevention purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>ACCESSING AND CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
      <p>You can view and edit your account information yourself after logging in. If you delete your account, we may retain some information for as long as necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, evaluate website usage, troubleshoot issues, resolve disputes, and collect any fees owed. If you have any questions or wish to ask to access, modify, or delete any of your personal data on our website, please contact us. Note that we can deny your request if we think it would violate any laws or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
      <p><strong>CALIFORNIA RESIDENT NOTICE</strong></p>
      <p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section as defined in the California Consumer Protection Act (the &ldquo;CCPA&rdquo;).</p>
      <p>We will not share your personal data with third parties for their direct marketing purposes to the extent it is forbidden by law. If our practices change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify you in advance. CCPA requires that operators of online services disclose how they respond to a Do Not Track signal. Some browsers have incorporated &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked. At this time we do not respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>
      <p><strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your personal data over the past 12 months. We will provide you with the following information in a portable and easily accessible format within 45 days of your request:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The categories of personal data that we have collected about you.</li>
        <li>The categories of sources from which that personal data was collected.</li>
        <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal data.</li>
        <li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete the personal data that we have collected from you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may retain some information for as long as necessary to fulfill our legal obligations, provide our services to you, and collect any fees owed. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request.</p>
      <p><strong>Exercising Your Rights:</strong> To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request at [Insert Email Address].</p>
      <p><strong>No Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. This means that you cannot be denied goods or services, charged different prices, or provided different quality of goods or services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.</p>
      <p><strong>COLORADO, CONNECTICUT AND UTAH RESIDENT NOTICES</strong></p>
      <p>If you are a resident of Utah, Colorado, or Connecticut, you have certain rights and choices you should know about:</p>
      <p>Notice at Collection: You have a right to receive notice of our practices before or when we collect your information, including the categories of information and sensitive personal information collected, the purposes for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is sold or shared, and how long such information is retained. You can find those details in this policy under the headers above.</p>
